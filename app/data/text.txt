Implementation details:

Key Fetaures:


Lessons Learned:
To use servernside components unless absolutelt neccasry (for onClick event or so). Server side components are so convient,i dont have have to worry about make a laoding state but most importantly because of  suspanse boundries. Suspanase boundraies make user expreience much better.
My favrouitr part of this project is the manga chapter page, where i can view the manga. This is achieved because of pupetter. I learned pupperteer for thisproject and was supriesd by how beginner friendly it was.

Future Improvement:
Make most compoennts server side. This is because i want to use suspense boundries to increase peroformance. Also sever compnents cache automatically which will agian increase performace.
